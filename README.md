## gem5 in docker for machine learning
### What is it?
This builds a docker image that contains gem5, ROCm, and MIOpen (using HIP). It's intended for running machine learning programs in the APU model in the GCN3 branch of gem5.

The container uses ROCm 1.6.2; This can be overridden when building the docker image.

### How to build/run?
[The dockerhub repo](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/registry-1.docker.io/kroarty/gem5) Will contain an image for this branch soon. Currently it only has the non-ML-enabled image.

From source:
```
docker build [--build-arg rocm_ver=<version>] -t <im_name> .
docker run [--name <container_name>] -it [-d] <im_name> [<command>]
```
If '-d' is specified, the container will run in the background \
If '\<command\>' isn't specified, the container will run a bash shell

### Building gem5 in the container

To keep filesize down, gem5 is not pre-built. So on the initial run of a container, gem5 needs to be built.

When attached to the container:
```
cd /gem5
scons -j$(nproc) build/GCN3_X86/gem5.opt --ignore-style
```
When running the container in the background:
`docker exec -w/gem5 <container_name> scons -j$(nproc) /sim/gem5/build/GCN3_X86/gem5.opt --ignore-style`

### Misc

* Why ROCm 1.6.2?

It's the most recent of the 1.6.x version that doesn't crash when running DNNMark's fwd_softmax test.
* Why can't we use ROCm 1.6.0?

It unpacks into a different directory structure than 1.6.1-1.6.4; This can be changed in the dockerfile, line 31. After ${rocm_ver}, add '/debian' and it will build

### ToDo
* Check dependencies, if any more are needed or if any can be removed
* Allow building with docker-compose
